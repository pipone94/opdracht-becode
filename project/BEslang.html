        Belgium is situated in the west of Europe, bordered to the north by the
        Netherlands, to the east by Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
        and to the south and the west by France. Although its surface area of
        30,688 km2 makes it a small country, its location has made it the
        economic and urban nerve centre of Europe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="a">
        Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, German, and French. About
        55% of people speak Dutch as their mother tongue and 16% speak it as a
        second language. French is spoken by about 36% of people as a mother
        tongue and half of Belgians as a second language.

            <p>
              Moin is the shortening of the phrase, “Guten Morgen” or good morning
              in parts of northern Germany.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But lots of people have adopted this as a way of saying “Hello!” in
              German slang, regardless of what time it is.

          <div class="column right">
            <p>
              When the German language isn't using five words to describe one thing,
              it's using one word to try and describe everything.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Krass is one of those words, because it can be used to portray both
              good and bad emotion in equal measure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>“Krass! Der typ is Irre!”, (What!? That guy is a lunatic)</p>

          </div>
      
          <div class="column right">
            <p>Irre is used the same way in German as crazy! is used in English.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              t has both good, and bad, connotations depending on how you use it.
              But mostly it's used to express bad situations.
            </p>
            <br />

          </div>
          <div class="column right">
            <p>
              Geil is a word used to describe anything you feel is cool, tasty or an
              interesting surprise. But it's also an odd word because “geil”
              technically means, well…horny.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>“Man, das Essen war so geil!”- Man, that food was amazing!</p>

            <p>Bescheuert roughly translates to dumb or stupid in English.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But it also comes with the connotation that someone is one sandwich
              short of a picnic, or their head is, well… up their arsch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It's not uncommon to hear Germans referring to particular politicians
              as “Total bescheuert!”

              'Se débrouiller' means 'to get out of somewhere/to get by', something
              Dutch speakers will not understand if you translate it literally.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In Belgium they drew up their plan and simply translated the Dutch

              A 'stain' is something dirty in Dutch, but in French-speaking Belgium

              In Flanders, they often find 'Hollanders' to have a 'thick neck' if

            <br />
            <p>(we will never know how to make gold out of something worthless).</p>
            <p>
              This has been adopted in Brussels: there is no talk of grande gueule

            <p>
              Bloquer is an integral part of Belgian culture because of 'de blok' or
              'le blocus'. Twice a year the students retire to their kot (student
              room), where they study until the early hours.

              The unlucky ones who 'tubes' (Flemish for failling class ) for a trade
              may continue to 'block' or mentally block in the 'second seat', that
              is of course also possible.
